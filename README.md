# 👋 Hi, I'm Mateusz

I'm a passionate and experienced software engineer, programming commercially since **2011**. I specialize in both backend and frontend development, with a deep love for **Rust**, **TypeScript**, and **JavaScript** (though I'm no longer looking for JavaScript-heavy roles – thank you!).

## 🧠 About Me

Mateusz is a seasoned software engineer and team leader who has worked with some of the world’s biggest brands, including **FOX Broadcasting**, **FX**, **FXX**, and **National Geographic**. I played a key role in **designing**, **documenting**, and **building scalable systems** used by **hundreds of thousands of users**.

Currently, I’m pushing the boundaries of design, technology, and innovation to deliver **new shared reality experiences** to partners worldwide at **[@Cosm](https://cosm.com/)**.

## 💻 Tech I Use and Love

- 🦀 **Rust** – for building fast, safe, and scalable systems.
- ⚙️ **Node.js**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **gRPC** – for robust backends and infrastructure.
- 🔍 **Elasticsearch**, **MongoDB**, **DynamoDB** – for powerful and flexible data storage and search.
- 🧠 **React.js**, **TypeScript** – for modern, clean, interactive frontend apps.

## 🏗️ What I Build

I enjoy crafting:
- Desktop and web applications
- High-performance distributed systems
- Scalable, real-time APIs and event-driven architectures

## ⚠️ No JavaScript-heavy Roles, Please

While I have years of JavaScript experience, I'm **not interested** in jobs where JavaScript is the **primary** language anymore. I'm focused on deeper systems, performance, and innovation.
